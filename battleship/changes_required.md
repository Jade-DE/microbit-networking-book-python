# Changes required:

Task 2)
- Change task so that the shot selector does not start at (0,0) which is not on the gameboard, but rather at (0,1) which is the top left of the playable area
- Perhaps the task should require leds to be lit up when selecting where to fire

Extended task)
- Jonathan created a variation on the extended task which fires multiple shots when A+B is pressed but each shot has a chance of failing to land. The user would have to use retransmissions to construct this and the board would need to light up an led to show that all the shots you fired failed to land.
