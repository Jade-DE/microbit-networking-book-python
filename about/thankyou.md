Acknowledgements
================

The activities in this book are based on the first "Networking with Micro:bit" Book.  

The activities were based on numerous discussions with Jonny Austin of the Micro:bit Foundation 
and David Whale ([@whaleygeek](https://twitter.com/whaleygeek)).

This book also would not have been possible without the support of Adam Leach, Director of New Ventures at Nominet, UK. 
Nominet continues to support [the Micro:bit Educational Foundation](https://www.microbit.org) in inspiring "every child to create
their best digital future".
