# Changes required:

Task 1)
- Replace MakeCode with Python blocks
- Task may need to be tweaked as it asks to turn on group 0 in the radio, but group 0 is enabled by default in Python once the radio has been turned on. Maybe change the task to turning the radio on in Python

Task 2)
- Replace MakeCode with Python blocks
- The files provided _SendNumber.hex_ and _SendString.hex_ cannot be used to test the program written by the user
