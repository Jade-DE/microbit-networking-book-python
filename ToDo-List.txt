1. Complete about/acknowledgements. 
2. Update credits about/license.md
3. Update editions in index.md when the online version of Python book becomes avavailable. 
4. Update authors in index.md
5. Update wiredcommunication.md so that Exercise 1 becomes a main task, and instructions are given for it. 
6. Update all chapters so that there is a link for solutions.
7. Broadcast: Add SendNumberOrString.py to the repository under the code folder
8. Group Communication: Implement Exercise using IETF RFC 3927 using link-local address selection. Group leaders set-up address, and invite others.
Assumption: Common group for organisation. 
Basic algorithm: 
1. Select a random address addr between 1 and 255
2. Pick a random 0 - PROBE_WAIT seconds.
3. For   PROBE_NUM times
    1. Ask if addr is taken
    2. Wait randomly between PROBE_MIN and PROBE_MAX
    3. If receives a response or receives another probe for the same address, back off. Start from step 1.
4. If nothing is received during this time, then claim address.
