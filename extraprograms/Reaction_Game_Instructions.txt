Reaction Game:

Press A to start
Perfrom gesture shown by the microbit:
* 'A' - press button A
* 'B' - press button B
* 'L' - tilt microbit left
* 'R' - tilt microbit right
* 'S' - shake microbit
Each player begins with 3 seconds per turn, perfroming a correct gesture will shorten your next turn by 0.25s
If you run out of time on your turn you lose and yur opponent wins

V2 differences:

In this version performing the incorrect gesture on your turn will also cause you to lose
e.g. pressing button A when you were supposed to tilt left
In V1 the microbit would ignore any incorrect gestures
Shake has been removed in this version as the microbit would often confuse the gesture with another
